- What is striping when talking about writing to a Hard drive?
  - use drives in parallel 
  - For example, if we need to read a large file, instead of pulling it all from a single hard disk, it is much faster to chop it up into pieces, store some of the pieces on each of the drives in an array, and then use all the disks to read back the file when needed.

- What is RAID and what functionality can it give you?
  - redundant array of independent disks 
  - data storage combine multiple physical disk drive components into one for data redundancy and performance
