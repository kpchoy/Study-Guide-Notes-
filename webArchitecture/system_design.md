- What are the 9 areas of inquiry that you you should define froma high level before diving into- implementation?
  - features 
  - define API
  - availability 
  - latency performance 
  - scalability
  - durability 
  - class diagram 
  - security & privacy 
  - cost effective 
- compare ACID vs. BASE
  - ACID - relational databases 
  - BASE - NoSQL databases 
- What is consistent hashing?
  -  represents requests and server nodes in ring structure "hash ring"
  - infinite number of points on ring, server can be placed at random locations on ring, the requests (keys) are also put on same ring 
- What is optimistic vs. pessimistic locking?
  - optimistic - do not enquire any locks, but ready to commit transaction check that the version has not changed 
  - pessimistic - lock record for your exclusive use until you are done with it  
- What is strong vs. eventual consistency?
  - strong: reads will always see latest writes - relational databases 
  - eventual: will see some writes eventuallys ee latest writes 
- What is a bloom Filter?
  - space efficient data structure 
  - if an element is part of a set or not
  - can have false positives, but never false negatives
- What is PAXOS?
  - derives conesus over distributed host
- OOP design patterns, singletons, Virtual- Machines, Containers,
  - singletons: restricts instantiation of class to one object
  - virtual machines: based on computer architecture and provide functionality of physical computer 
    - operating system on top of a shared resources so you feel that you are owner of hardware
  - containers: running application and dependencies in an isolated environment 
    - sit on top of physical server and host OS
    - shared componenets are read only
- What is Pub-Sub pattern?
  - messaging pattern 
  - categorize publish messages into classes
  - subscribers express interest in one or more classes and receive messages of interest
- What is Map Reduce?
  - distrubted and parallel processing of big data
  - map filter and sortin data
  - reduce summerizing data 
- What is multi-threading?
  - central processing unit to execute multiple threads concurrently
- What is Redis?
  - distrubted cache, hold data in memory 
  - key value storage
  - setup as a cluster 
  - only hold limited amount of data permitted by host
- What is Kafka?
  - used in real time streaming data architecture to provide real time analytics 
- What are NGINX and HAProxy?
  - load balancers, very efficient
- What is Docker?
  - software platform for writing containers  
- What is Hadoop/Spark?
  - map reduce
