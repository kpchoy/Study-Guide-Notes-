- What is the matter with the Naive solution for Timeline?
  - use relational databases 
    - user table
    - tweet tabel, has a user id column 
    - 1 to many relationship, user can have many tweets
    - SELECT statement give me all the tweets for all the ppl i follow, scanning whole tweets table 
- How would you ensure high availability of the timeline?
  - load balancer 
  - fan out- take tweet put in precompute database 
  - reds: precommputed database 
  - every home twitter feed is replicated 3 times
  - redis servers have a huge amount of memory, only store tweets users active last few eeks
