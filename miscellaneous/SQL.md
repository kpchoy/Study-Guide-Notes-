- In which order does SQL execute its queries? Make sure to mention `SELECT`, `JOIN`, 'WHERE', `GROUPBY`
  1) `FROM` and `JOINS`
  2) `WHERE`
  3) `GROUP BY`
  4) `HAVING`
  5) `SELECT`
  6) `ORDER BY`
  7) `LIMIT`  

- What are the different type of SQL Joins?
  - Inner, left, right, and full 
- What is the difference between an Inner Join and a Left Join?
  - Inner join sets all record from table A and B where join condition is met 
  - Left join sets `all records` from tabel A, along with `records` from Table B, which join condition is met 

- Where in a SQL query may we use a sub query (After which SQL keyword?)
  - easiest to start with `FROM`
