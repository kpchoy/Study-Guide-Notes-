- What is the time complexity of inserting into a sorted singly-linked LL? How can you do it in one pass only
 - if linkedlist empty make node as head and return it
 - if val node insert < val node head. make it the head
 - in a loop find node with val greater than (val insert node), and place (insert node) before (node with greater val)
 - O(n) use double pointers 
- What do you have to do to delete a node from a list?
  - when node to be deleted is first node. copy data of next node to head node and delete the next node
  - else find previous node and changing next of previous node 

- How may we compare two string using a Linked List?
  - O(n), minimum lenght of both linked list 
  - head of first and head second linked list
  - check whether each characters are matched, stop when either end of linked list is reached or current chars do not match
  - if both lists not empty, compare mismatching characters
  - if either of the two lists has reached end return 1 or -1
  - if none of conditions is true, both lists reach end, so return 0 
- Explain how you handle numbers of different sizes when summing two Linked Lists?
  - calculate sizes of two linked list
  - if sizes are same, calc sum using recursion. Hold all nodes in recursion call stack till the rightmost node, calc sum of rightmost nodes and forward carry to left side.
  - if size not the same,
    - calc difference of sizes of two linked lists. let difference be `diff`
    - move `diff` nodes ahead in bigger linked list. calc sum of smaller list and right sub-list. Also store the carry of this sum
    - calculate the sum of the carry, with remaining left sub-list of larger list. Nodes of this sum are added at the beginning of sum list
