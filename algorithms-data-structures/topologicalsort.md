- Give an example of a use-case for Topological Sort?
  - scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs 
- What is a difference between Topological Sort and DFS?
  - we need to print a vertex before its adjacent verticies
- On which types of Graphs can we do a topological sort?
  - (DAG) Directed Acylic Graph - every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before vertex v in ordering 
- What data structure do we use to assist with the topological sort algorithm?
  - DFS
