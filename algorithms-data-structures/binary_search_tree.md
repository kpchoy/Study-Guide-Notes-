 - What are the constraints of a Binary Search Tree?
   - pointers, need more space 
 - What is the big O lookup time for a value in a binary search tree?
   - in general big O is O (h) where h is the height of the binary search tree 
   - worst case O(n)

- How can you find the maximum depth of a BST?
  - max depth is height - 1
- How can you determine what the Least common ancestor of two nodes is?
  - traversing up using parent pointer, and printing the first intersecting node
