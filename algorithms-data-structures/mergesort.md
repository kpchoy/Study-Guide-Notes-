- Explain the pseudocode for Merge Sort
  - `Divide` and break up the problem into smallest "subproblem" of same type 
  - `Conquer` and tackle smallest subproblems first. solve subproblems recursively 
  - `Combine` the answers and build up smaller problems until end up with solution 

- What is the runtime of merge sort?
  - n log n
