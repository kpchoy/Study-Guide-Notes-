- What is the Floyd-Warchall algorithm good for?\
  - find shortest distance between verticies in a given edge weighted directed graph
- How does it work?
  - initialize solution matrix same as input graph
  - update soln matrix consider all verticies as intermediate vertexes 
  - one by one pick all vertices and update all shortest paths, which include picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in shortest path
